    "### Programming problem 2\n",
    "Given two ***sorted* linked lists**, merge them in place (on the given linked lists) without using extra space (only one or two additional space allowed) and without modifying links of the first linked list. The solution should preserve the sorted order of elements in both lists. More precisely, if $m$ and $n$ are the number of nodes in the first and second linked lists respectively, then the first $m$ smallest nodes in both lists combined should become in the resulting first sorted linked list. The remaining nodes will go to the resulting second sorted linked list.  \n",

This can be done in O($m$ + $n$) time and constant space.\n",

    "The above solution violates the problem constraints that modifying the links of the first list is not allowed and may use linear space for an additional linked list using for the interim resulting linked list. Please provide a program to merge the two given sorted linked lists in place according to the problem constraints and discuss the time and space complexity. Things you need to provide include:\n",
    "1. Since the input is Python lists of integers, you need to have the function. `readInputListintoLinkedList()`, to read the integers and generate the corresponding linked lists.\n",

    "3. The functions for the merging process, `mergeLinkedLists()`.\n",
